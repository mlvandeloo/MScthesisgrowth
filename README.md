# Humanized Sterol Biosynthesis (HsS) Growth Analysis

This document describes the data wrangling and analysis steps used to analyze and visualize growth behaviour of humanized strains for my thesis (TBD). Two raw data files are included - raw and data paths must be specified, but this code can be repeated for educational applications, i.e. other lab members wishing to repeat these analysis methods for new strains or additional experiments.
